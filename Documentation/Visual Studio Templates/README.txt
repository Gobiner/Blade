These templates make it easy to create views, presenters, and models for Blade

To use them just place them in your Visual Studio user templates folder, e.g.

C:\Users\yourname\Documents\Visual Studio 2012\Templates\ItemTemplates\Blade

Then in VS go to add an item and you'll see a new Blade category in the add items window.
